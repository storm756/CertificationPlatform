# Changelog

## 2026-11-08: Stage 0, foundation and server
- Django 5.2 project skeleton, settings split (dev/staging/prod) read from env vars. Why: architecture §4, §17.
- Custom email `User` (with `email_normalized`, role, status) in the first migration. Why: can't be swapped later.
- allauth + `allauth.mfa`; staff must set up TOTP before reaching anything but the auth pages (middleware); admin login goes through allauth; staff sessions 12 h. django-unfold admin.
- Postgres roles `csfr_owner` (migrations) / `csfr_app` (runtime) created by `deploy/db/init-roles.sh`.
- Docker: `compose.dev.yml`; `compose.yml` (web, db, cron, staging-only mailpit) per environment; **`compose.edge.yml` (shared Caddy)**, because staging and prod are separate stacks on one host and only one process can own ports 80/443.
- `deploy/deploy.sh`, `deploy/server/bootstrap.sh` (hardening), encrypted hourly `pg_dump` + nightly media to B2 (write-only key), `deploy/restore.sh`.
- GitHub Actions CI: ruff, pytest on Postgres, `check --deploy`, shellcheck, compose/Caddy validation, image builds.
